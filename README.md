# Anki-Vector SDK with Keras neural network and Image-Net database

This script was largely modeled after user `unbug`'s and `hassanhabib`'s programs. They used Google Cloud Service and Azure to do to image processing where I wanted a solution using all open source features.

I tested this in Python 3.6.4 with Anaconda.

Make sure dependencies are installed. The functions are labeled pretty well or self explanatory.

Let me know if you have any questions.
